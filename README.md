**India 2011 Census Analysis using SQL**

This project aims to analyze the India 2011 Census data using SQL. The dataset includes information on various attributes such as District, State, Growth, Sex Ratio, Literacy, Area (in square kilometers), and Population.

**Tools Used**

MySQL: The project utilizes the MySQL database management system to store and query the dataset.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

District: Name of the district in India.

State: Name of the state to which the district belongs.

Growth: Growth rate of the district's population.

Sex_Ratio: Ratio of females to males in the district.

Literacy: Literacy rate in the district.

Area_km2: Area of the district in square kilometers.

Population: Total population of the district.

**SQL Concepts and Techniques Applied**

The following SQL concepts and techniques are utilized in this project:

Aggregate Functions: Calculating aggregate values such as average, sum, minimum, maximum, etc.

Joining of Tables: Combining data from multiple tables based on common columns.

Group By: Grouping the data based on specific columns.

Window Functions: Performing calculations over a set of rows that are related to the current row.

Filtering of Data: Selecting specific rows based on certain conditions.

Union Function: Combining the results of multiple queries into a single result set.

Logical Operators: Using logical operators like AND, OR, NOT for combining conditions.

Arithmetic Operators: Performing arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

Comparison Operators: Comparing values to check for equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.
